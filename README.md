# 🐍 Python Loops Assignment

This project contains three beginner-friendly Python programs that demonstrate the use of **loops** (`while` and `for`) to solve practical problems.
It was created as part of a learning assignment to strengthen loop fundamentals in Python.

### ✅ Task 1: Countdown Timer (Using `while` loop)
A simple countdown timer that takes a starting number from the user and counts down to 1, finishing with a celebratory message.

**Example:**
Enter a starting number: 5
5 4 3 2 1 Blast off! 🚀

### ✅ Task 2: Multiplication Table (Using `for` loop)
Generates the multiplication table (up to 12) for a number provided by the user.

**Example:**
Enter a number: 4
4 x 1 = 4
4 x 2 = 8
...
4 x 12 = 48

### ✅ Task 3: Factorial Calculator (Using `for` loop)
Calculates the factorial of a number input by the user.

**Example:**
Enter a number: 5
The factorial of 5 is 120.
