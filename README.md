# Python Gen AI Project

This project was created as part of a Python assignment focused on:
- Using variables
- Performing basic math operations
- Applying conditional statements
- Handling errors gracefully

## Tasks Covered

- **Task 1**: Create and print name, age, and height
- **Task 2**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Task 3**: Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
In the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
python Main.py

** Sample output **

Hey there, my name is Chinenye! I'm 30 years old and 5.8 feet tall. I'm from the United States and I love to code.

The sum of 10 and 20 is: 30
The difference when 20 is subtracted from 10 is: -10
The product of 10 and 20 is: 200
The result of dividing 10 by 20 is: 0.5

Quick! Enter a number: -5
Yikes, thatâ€™s a negative number. I need to work harder!
